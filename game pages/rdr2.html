        <p>From the fantastic <strong>Rockstar Games</strong>, <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> takes place in America, 1899.<br> The story follows <i>Arthur Morgan</i> and the notorious <i>Van der Linde</i> gang on the run after a robbery gone bad. To survive as outlaws in the last era of the wild-west, the <i>Van der Linde</i> gang is forced to fight for basic survival, be it because they need money, food, a place to stay, basic amenities, or even to rescue some of their members from the federals of America. You're questioned with morality through-out the story, as in-fighting begins and threatens the livelyhood of the gang. <i>Arthur Morgan</i> must make a difficult decision, does he abide by his morality, or break his moral values for the sake of the gang? </p>

Within the towns, you can come across domesticated dogs, which you can pet until your hearts content!</p>
