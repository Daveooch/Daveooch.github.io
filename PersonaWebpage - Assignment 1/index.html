                <p>My name is David, and I'm a student at <b><i>Humber Polytechnic</i></b> for Computer Programming! I spend most of my time completing assignments, and persuing hobbies whenever I have the time to! Outside of that, I also take care of my three beloved pet birds, two of which are <i>budgierigars</i>, and the odd one out being a <i>cockatiel</i>! Now before I get to letting you know a little about me, first let me introduce you to my world; my pet birds!</p>

                <br>The one you see rudely breaking through the header of my webpage is Fidellity! She's one of my two budgies, I've had her for about 4 years now. Her name is a little odd, but I still love her nonetheless! Below is Walter, the second and youngest budgie. The second we introduced him to Fidellity, they got paired into an inseperable bond!</br><br><img class="Walter" src="Images/Walter.png" alt="Walter fixing his chest floof"></br>

                <p>As mentioned before, my name is David, and I'm a full-time student at Humber Polytechnic! Outside of school, I'm a massive nerd, which if it wasn't obvious already. I absolutely geek out on anything zoology related, be it entomology or ornithology, I cannot express my love for the diverse world our planet holds! Other than gawking at science, I play alot of videogames & and read a bunch of books, as well as dabbling in history textbooks every now and then. Most of my favourite of both books & games hold heavy storytelling and super unforgettable moments that let you walk away with more than just a dopamine boost! To list a few, my favourite pieces of media, both book & videogame, has got to be the <i>Dark Souls</i> trilogy & <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. Both those stories hold a very personal connection with myself & my interests, especially with the <i>Dark Souls</i> trilogy! It really tickles the fancy of the complete geek in me & hits close to home in it's especially non-linear story telling. To specify, Dark Souls is a huge metaphor for depression; you're constantly trying to find a reason to push forward, and to not become a husk of your former self. The game guises itself behind a dark-gothic medieval fantasy setting, with honestly one of the greatest musical compositions I've heard in any piece of media <b>ever</b>. <a href="https://youtu.be/3bqLGebDRIY?si=7u1OQVeGLx2znAs2">Linked here is my favourite song that plays during the final part of the first installment in the series</a>. As for <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, I love it for being one of the biggest pieces in historical literature, plus the story is fantasticly written & includes many horror elements, which I also absolutely love! Did I mention I'm also heavy into music and art? Shocker, I know! There's never not a moment where you can spot me with headphones & a sketchpad during my breaks, although I only consume music and am extremely amateur at what I draw, It's still fun to grow that skill and admire other's art!</p>
